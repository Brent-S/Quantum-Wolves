Quantum-Wolves
==============

A java implementation of the game 'Quantum Werewolves".

I've just discovered that whilst all my custom dialogs appear fine on my peculiar linux window theme, they do not when run on Windows 7.
So if anyone sees something odd, could they let me know steps to reproduce...

Also, I don't know if there is any point in having a jar uploaded, but I thought it would make it easier for windows-y peeps to download and run without much effort.
