Quantum-Wolves
==============

A java implementation of the game 'Quantum Werewolves".


I don't know if there is any point in having a jar uploaded, but I thought it would make it easier for windows-y peeps to run without much effort.

I managed to break it (eliminating all possible gamestates) but I don't know how, and can't reproduce it...  If anyone has any wise ideas, let me know.
