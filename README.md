Quantum-Wolves
==============

A java implementation of the game 'Quantum Werewolves".

Does it centre the windows for anyone? Mine doesn't at all, but I don't know if it's an issue with OpenJDK and dual monitors...

Also, I don't know if there is any point in having a jar uploaded, but I thought it would make it easier for windows-y peeps to run without much effort.
